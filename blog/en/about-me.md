# Who am I?
Hello, I'm Peter, on github knowns as [Feft](https://github.com/Feft).
I live in Poland, Earth. 

Skilled in php, symfony, mysql, docker, software architecture. Object-oriented programming is my passion. The most important principle of programming is __WDD - wish driven development__. How it works?

* think about the task - understand customer requirements
* write a class skeleton
* try it - if works, write method's body.
* remember about [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and [others programming principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles).
